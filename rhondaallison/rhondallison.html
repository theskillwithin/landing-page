            <h3>Rhonda Allison Company History</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>
            How it all began: In the early 1990's, Rhonda worked extensively and after years of education and research with biochemists and doctors, she produced a video on "The Art of Skin Peeling" that became renowned in the industry for its state-of-the-art techniques, as this was done in a time when acids and chemical peels were not yet part of mainstream technology. Her groundbreaking work in this area and her ensuing line of skin care items has earned Rhonda Allison skincare worldwide recognition. Rhonda Allison focuses heavily on using only organic, natural products, such as the Rhonda Allison pumpkin cleanser, or the Rhonda Allison growth factor serum, to give your skin the nutrition it needs to remain healthy, vibrant, and full of life. Rhonda Allison aims to please even the most discerning consumer. Try Rhonda Allison products and experience a transformation of your own!

              Question: Are Rhonda Allison products chemical free?<p>&nbsp;</p>
              Answer: Chemicals are any substances with a distinct molecular composition. Chemicals can be natural or synthetic and are present in just about everything on earth, so a claim of chemical free can be a bit misleading. Rhonda Allison products, as do all skincare products, contain some types of natural and safe chemicals. Rhonda Allison has been dedicated to creating skincare products that do not contain harmful or dangerous chemicals. Rhonda Allison believes that dangerous chemicals can not only be harmful to user but, are in fact, counterproductive to skincare. Rhonda Allison is dedicated to creating products which are made from the purest and freshest ingredients, natural colors, natural scents, and only the highest quality preservatives. Rhonda Allison's skincare products are scientifically developed to combine all-natural ingredients with uniquely designed compounds to ensure you skin's health and youth. For instance Rhonda Allison's sun protection products contain, SPF, Zinc Oxide and Titanium Oxide (metals) extracts of algae, and herb complex of Sandalwood, Corktree and Barley. These ingredients are combined to create natural chemical compositions which will protect you skin from the damaging rays of the sun, but the product can be said to be chemical-free, as no synthetic chemicals have been added to the mixture. Other products like Rhonda Allison's cleansers contain Glycolic Acid polymers which can be classified as a chemical but are completely safe and actually exfoliate the surface of the skin leaving it smooth and clean as the chemical gently removes dead and damaged skin. <p>&nbsp;</p>
              Question: What are the best Rhonda Allison products?<p>&nbsp;</p>
              Answer: Trying to find the best Rhonda Allison products may not be an easy answer, as most people will have unique skin needs and conditions. Rhonda Allison's products have been developed to treat specific needs so the best product for you may not be the best product for the next person. That being said there are some products that can and should be used by everyone regardless of skin type or skin condition. Everyone goes outside and everyone is exposed to the harmful ray of the sun. Rhonda Allison's sun protection product is a great solution to protect and rejuvenate your skin. This product is made from all natural ingredients and is free of harmful chemicals. Rhonda Allison's cleansers are another great solution for any skin type or condition. These cleansers will gently clean and properly moisturize your skin, and is a beneficial product offering important nutrients and nourishing support. Scrubs are also an important, and often over-looked, cleansing product great for all users. These scrubs will polish, replenish, stimulate, and exfoliate the skin by lifting away dead skin cells. Lotions and toners can be used daily and is a must use product as they contain antioxidants to aid in age reversing effects. The eyes show age more than any other area of the face, and eye care is another one of Rhonda Allison's products that will provide great results regardless of skin type or condition. The best products may be the products you need for daily skincare, look for these Rhonda Allison products for great results. <p>&nbsp;</p>
              Question: What are the best Rhonda Allison products for pregnant skin?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>
              Answer: While many women experience a wonderful glow during pregnancy many are not so lucky. Hormonal changes can have adverse skin effects such as, acne, melasma, and rosacea. Many women, worried about their health and the health of their unborn child, are not comfortable using any product which may introduce harmful chemicals into their systems. There are some active ingredients which should never be used during pregnancy, but some are mild enough to be used safely. Pregnancy does not have to be the end of skincare, and Rhonda Allison has designed the perfect skincare solution that is gentle and safe enough for all expected mothers. The facial is not only a relaxing and wonderful skin treatment but with the right combination of Rhonda Allison's skincare products it can be very safe to use when expecting. The Beta Green Tea cleanser is a great antioxidant and perfect for those experiencing acne or rosacea, and its anti-inflammatory properties make it great for soon to be moms. The exfoliant, Brightening scrub, is gentle enough for pregnant moms and will leave the face lighter, brighter, and cleaner. Rhonda Allison's Antioxidant Complex will return your skin to its optimal moister levels while firming and toning the face. The Grape Seed Parfait can be used to prevent and correct moister loss. Daily Defense SF 30 will protect your skin from the sun, and is chemical-free, an important notion for moms to be.
