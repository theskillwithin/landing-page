	<p>Vertere was developed from the desire of creator, Bethany Hilt, to eliminate the need to layer multiple products to provide the cocktail of ingredients needed to achieve clear, even, unlined skin.</p>
	<p>Bethany began making skin care products with her grandmother when she was six years old, and passionately researched ingredients from a young age through adulthood to understand which ingredients truly performed and the percentages to seek, which ingredients clogged pores and more.  Bethany developed Vertere (which is Latin, meaning "to turn") out of her frusteration with not only layering multiple products morning and night to get results but also because she couldn't find anti-aging products that didn't contribute to breakouts.</p>
	<p>Vertere is the first and only line of the skin care specifically created to simultaneously improve the appearance of aging, hyperpigmentation and adult acne with one regimen for all skin tones.  It is created to be used by women and men of any age, and a broad range of skin types.  Vertere utilizes the most advanced scientific and natural/organic ingredients available at clinically proven levels to produce a deliberate, highly effective line of luxury skin care.</p>
