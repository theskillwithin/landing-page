	<p>Lending luxury with clinical performance, <strong>Vertere</strong> is the first and only skin care brand specifically created to improve the appearance of aging, hyperpigmentation and adult acne with one regimen and it may be used by all skin tones.</p>
	<p><strong>Vertere's</strong> multifunctional, synergistic blend of proven, clinically active scientific and natural ingredients produces visible results rapidly without going through multiple steps, without using multiple products and without breaking out as a result.  We use multiple key ingredients at clinically proven levels rather than simply one 'star' ingredient or minimal concentrations.</p>
	<p><strong>Vertere</strong> is also non-toxic - it's hydroquinone-free, paraben-free, phthalate-free and more.</p>
