 <p>Karin Herzog is the worldwide leader in oxygen-based skincare. It is the only range formulated with stabilized active oxygen, which acts as a rocket booster, propelling essential nutrients to the collagen producing cells.
 
Our revolutionary skin care line was founded over 40 years ago in Switzerland by Nobel Institute honoree Dr. Paul Herzog. We are still run by the Herzog family today and all of our prodcuts are produced in our lab in Switzerland. </p>
