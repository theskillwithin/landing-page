	<h6 style="font-size: 22px; color: #d1bb8f;">The Power Of Oxygen is At The Heart Of Our World</h6>
	<p><strong>Karin Herzog</strong> is the worldwide leader in oxygen-based skincare. It is the only skin care line that is formulated with stabilized active oxygen.</p>
	<p>The oxygen, in the patented formula, acts as a rocket booster, propelling essential nutrients deep into the epidermis to nourish the collagen producing cells below. Its power is only released when the cream comes into contact with the skin. So all the nourishing and revitalizing ingredients are saved for the areas you want to target, helping to transform the skin from the inside, out!</p>
	<h6 style="font-size: 22px; color: #d1bb8f;">Why is Oxygen So Important For Our Skin?</h6>
	<p>Oxygen is found naturally in the skin and is essential to hydrate, de-
toxify and nourish the skin cells. Its organic properties provide cells 
with the water and energy they need to produce collagen fibers
and elastin, which help to repair the skin and fight the signs of
aging.</p> <img style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px;" src="https://www.skincarebyalana.com/img/pages/karinherzog/karinherzog-thescience_1.jpg" alt="Karin Herzog">
<p>Oxygen is also one of nature’s strongest disinfectants and helps
	to kill bacteria in, and on the skin.</p>
	<p>As we get older, oxygen levels in the skin decline. By the age of just 25, there is already a substantial decline (up to 40%) in the skin’s oxygen level compared to that of a teenager. This depletion is accelerated by environmental and lifestyle factors such as smoking pollution, drinking alcohol, stress or illness.</p>
	<p>As a result the skin begins to look dull, blemished and lifeless. It does not function sufficiently on its own, and is more prone to the effects of aging.</p>
	<h6 style="font-size: 22px; color: #d1bb8f;">How Does The Patented Karin Herzog Formula Work?</h6>
	<img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px;" src="https://www.skincarebyalana.com/img/pages/karinherzog/karinherzog-thescience_2.jpg" alt="Karin Herzog">
	<p>When the cream is applied, the Catalase enzyme in the skin breaks down the barriers and each oxygen molecule is then free to react with another to form the gaseous O2, which then evaporates into the air. It is therefore difficult to stabilize active oxygen in a cream. However, Dr. Herzog discovered a formula that effectively creates mini barriers around each oxygen molecule, to stablize them in a liquid.</p> 
	<p>As O2 forms, it creates a microscopic ‘explosion’, producing a pressure that propels the oxygen, water and other active ingredients into the deep cellular layers of the skin. This flushes through the capillaries and boosts the collagen producing cells with the energy they need to repair, regulate and normalize vital skin funcations. The oxygen in Karin Herzog products is released from the active ingredient, hydrogen peroxide, along with water, an essential ingredient to energize, plump and revive the cells.</p>
	<p>It is important to note that simply adding hydrogen peroxide to a cream without stabilizing the oxygen will not have the same effect. Only the patented formula found in Karin Herzog products infuses the skin with usable and lasting oxygen.</p>
