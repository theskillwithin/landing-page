	<p>Dr. Herzog dedicated his entire medical career to the study of
	respiration and researching the powerful effects of oxygen on
	the body. He worked as a researcher for the renowned  Karol-
	inska Institute in Stockhold and was part of the preeminent
	team that developed the artificial respirator. His achievements
	culminated in 1964, when he received the title of Dr. Honoris
	Causa from the prestigious Nobel Assembly.</p>
	<p>After 30 years of relentless work, Dr. Herzog made the decision
	to retire. He and his wife, Karin, moved to the shores of the
	stunning Lake Geneva where they lived with their three daugh-
	ters Karina, Paulina, and Noelle.</p>
	<p>While in retirement Dr. Herzog’s active mind would not leave him in peace. He had a strong belief that the powerful antiseptic properties of oxygen could be used to treat medical skin conditions. However, active oxygen is very volatile and scientists before him had tried, and failed, to stabilize it in a liquid base.</p>
