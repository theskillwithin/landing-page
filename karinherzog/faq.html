	<h6 style="font-size: 22px; color: #be9e56;">Is Karin Herzog for all skin types?</h6>
	<p>Yes, if used correctly, Karin Herzog products are suitable for all skin types, even sensitive skin. All Karin Herzog products are paraben and preservative free and many do not even use any additional fragrances (check detailed ingredients). If your skin is sensitive, start using the products gradually. Apply the oxygen products every other night for two weeks, then increase to every night. Monitor the effect on your skin and possibly increase to using morning and night. If in doubt, you can always email me and my estheticians for assistance!</p>
	<h6 style="font-size: 22px; color: #be9e56;">How should I apply Karin Herzog’s Oxygen products?</h6>
	<p>Directions vary for each product. However, Karin Herzog recommends that you apply the products that contain active oxygen with a Karin Herzog facial or body brush rather than massaging them directly into the skin. This prevents the active ingredients being absorbed by the fingertips. Dr. Herzog’s patented oxygen formulas contain active oxygen, which stabilized in the cream but converts to its more effective gas form on contact with the skin.</p>
	<p>Application with a brush helps to ensure all of the transformative effects of the active ingredients are delivered directly to targeted areas rather than being absorbed by your hands.</p>
	<h6 style="font-size: 22px; color: #be9e56;">Can I mix Karin Herzog products with products from other brands?</h6>
	<p>Karin Herzog does not recommend mixing their products with other brands: the stabilized oxygen in their products may cause some ingredients (preservatives, for example) to penetrate deeper than they are designed to, thus causing unwanted reactions. If you wish to continue using your usual cleansing milk and lotion, rinse your skin with pure water before applying a Karin Herzog cream with oxygen.</p>
	<h6 style="font-size: 22px; color: #be9e56;">Do Karin Herzog Oxygen products bleach facial hair?</h6>
	<p>When using any of the Herzog oxygen products, please avoid contact with the eyebrow and hairline as the oxygen within the product may lighten hair over time.</p>
	<h6 style="font-size: 22px; color: #be9e56;">Which Vita-A-Kombi (VAK) should I use?</h6>
	<p>Everyone should start with Vita-A-Kombi 1. After using a full jar of VAK 1, consult with your esthetician about the possibility of moving up to a Vita-A-Kombi 2. If you have a challenging skin condition, VAK 2 will accelerate the results.</p>
	<p>For most clients, it is not necessary to go any higher than VAK 1. Vita-A-Kombi 3 should only be used to spot treat acne breakouts, blemishes and hyperpigmentation (dark spots). VAK 3 should not be used on the entire face but it may be used for treating wrinkles and hyper-pigmentation on the chest if applied locally.</p>
